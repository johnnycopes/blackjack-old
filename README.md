# Blackjack

### Live site: https://cool-blackjack.surge.sh/

This is a traditional game of Blackjack (aka "21"). Features ability to bet, double down, and split up to two hands. Built with HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript.

This project has enjoyed a long life of growth and refactoring: 
- _November 2016:_ Originally wrote the app in a functional programming style and then refactored it in an OO style
- _September 2017:_ Refactored to include Webpack, ES2015 features, and CSS Grid
- _March 2018:_ Converted the JavaScript to TypeScript

#### Goals of this project:

- Write everything in TS with no framework
- Set up a custom Webpack configuration to load all files and assets
- Make a sensible layout that leverages CSS Grid
- Deploy a lightweight production build (lots of images to load!)

#### To-do:

- Add animations to improve the UX

#### Local installation:

To run this locally on your machine, simply clone the repo and enter the following commands into your CLI:

```
npm install
npm run start
```
