# Blackjack

### Live site: _coming soon_

This is a traditional game of Blackjack (aka "21"). Features ability to bet, double down, and split up to two hands. Built with HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript.

This project has enjoyed a long life of growth and refactoring: I originally wrote it in a functional programming style and then refactored it in an OO style (November 2016); then I refactored it to include Webpack, ES2015 features, and CSS Grid (September 2017); and finally, I converted the JavaScript to TypeScript (March 2018).

#### Goals of this project:

- Write everything in TS with no framework
- Set up a custom Webpack configuration to load all files and assets
- Make a sensible layout that leverages CSS Grid
- Deploy a lightweight production build (lots of images to load!)


#### Local installation:

To run this locally on your machine, simply clone the repo and enter the following commands into your CLI:

```
npm install
npm run start
```
